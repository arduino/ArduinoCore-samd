# Arduino Core for SAMD21 CPU

This repository contains the source code and configuration files of the Arduino Core
for Atmel's SAMD21 processor (used on the Arduino Zero board and JACK board)

## Installation on Arduino IDE

The Arduino Zero core is available as a package in the Arduino IDE cores manager.
Just open the "Boards Manager" and install the package called:

"Arduino SAMD Boards (32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+)"

Next, clone this repository and move the following files/folders to C:\Users\mperla.CORP\AppData\Roaming\Arduino15\packages\arduino\hardware\samd\1.6.1 :

- bootloaders\jack
- cores\jack
- variants\jack
- boards.txt

## Contributions

Contributions are always welcome. The preferred way to receive code cotribution is by submitting a 
Pull Request on github.

## License and credits

The Arduino Zero core has been developed by Arduino LLC in collaboration with Atmel.

The JACK core has been developed by Michele Perla on top of the Arduino one, so GLPL applies to it as well.
