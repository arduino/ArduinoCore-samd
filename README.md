# Arduino Core for SAMD21 CPU

This repository containts the source code and configuration files of the Arduino Core
for Atmel's SAMD21 processor (used on the Arduino Zero board).

## Installation on Arduino IDE

This core is available as a package in the Arduino IDE cores manager.
Just open the "Boards Manager" and install the package called:

"Arduino SAMD Boards (32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+)"

## Support

There is a dedicated section of the Arduino Forum for general discussion and project assistance:

http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?board=98.0

## Bugs or Issues

If you find a bug you can submit an issue here on github:

https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-samd/issues

Before posting a new issue, please check if the same problem has been already reported by someone else
to avoid duplicates.

## Contributions

Contributions are always welcome. The preferred way to receive code cotribution is by submitting a 
Pull Request on github.

## Hourly builds

This repository is under a Continuos Integration system that every hour checks if there are updates and
builds a release for testing (the so called "Hourly builds").

The hourly builds are available through Boards Manager. If you want to install them:
  1. Open the **Preferences** of the Arduino IDE.
  2. Add this URL `http://downloads.arduino.cc/Hourly/samd/package_samd-hourly-build_index.json` in the **Additional Boards Manager URLs** field, and click OK.
  3. Open the **Boards Manager** (menu Tools->Board->Board Manager...)
  4. Install **Arduino SAMD core - Hourly build**
  5. Select one of the boards under **SAMD Hourly build XX** in Tools->Board menu
  6. Compile/Upload as usual

If you already installed an hourly build and you want to update it with the latest:
  1. Open the **Boards Manager** (menu Tools->Board->Board Manager...)
  2. Remove **Arduino SAMD core - Hourly build**
  3. Install again **Arduino SAMD core - Hourly build**, the Board Manager will download the latest build replacing the old one.
