/**
 * \page asfdoc_sam0_sercom_usart_dma_use_case Quick Start Guide for Using DMA with SERCOM USART
 *
 * The supported board list:
 *    - SAMD21 Xplained Pro
 *    - SAMR21 Xplained Pro
 *    - SAMR11 Xplained Pro
 *
 * This quick start will receiving 8 bytes of data from PC terminal and transmit back the string
 * to the terminal through DMA. In this use case the USART will be configured with the following
 * settings:
 * - Asynchronous mode
 * - 9600 Baudrate
 * - 8-bits, No Parity and 1 Stop Bit
 * - TX and RX enabled and connected to the Xplained Pro Embedded Debugger virtual COM port
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_sercom_usart_dma_use_case_setup Setup
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_sercom_usart_dma_use_case_prereq Prerequisites
 * There are no special setup requirements for this use-case.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_usart_dma_use_case_setup_code Code
 * Add to the main application source file, outside of any functions:
 * \snippet qs_usart_dma_use.c module_inst
 * \snippet qs_usart_dma_use.c dma_resource
 * \snippet qs_usart_dma_use.c usart_buffer
 * \snippet qs_usart_dma_use.c transfer_descriptor
 *
 * Copy-paste the following setup code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_usart_dma_use.c setup
 *
 * Add to user application initialization (typically the start of \c main()):
 * \snippet qs_usart_dma_use.c setup_init
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_usart_dma_use_case_setup_flow Workflow
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam0_usart_dma_use_case_setup_flow_inst Create variables
 * -# Create a module software instance structure for the USART module to store
 *    the USART driver state while it is in use.
 *    \snippet qs_usart_dma_use.c module_inst
 *    \note This should never go out of scope as long as the module is in use.
 *          In most cases, this should be global.
 *
 * -# Create module software instance structures for DMA resources to store
 *    the DMA resource state while it is in use.
 *    \snippet qs_usart_dma_use.c dma_resource
 *    \note This should never go out of scope as long as the module is in use.
 *          In most cases, this should be global.
 *
 * -# Create a buffer to store the data to be transferred /received
 *    \snippet qs_usart_dma_use.c usart_buffer
 * -# Create DMA transfer descriptors for RX/TX
 *    \snippet qs_usart_dma_use.c transfer_descriptor
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam0_usart_dma_use_case_setup_flow_usart Configure the USART
 * -# Create a USART module configuration struct, which can be filled out to
 *    adjust the configuration of a physical USART peripheral.
 *    \snippet qs_usart_dma_use.c setup_config
 * -# Initialize the USART configuration struct with the module's default values.
 *    \snippet qs_usart_dma_use.c setup_config_defaults
 *    \note This should always be performed before using the configuration
 *          struct to ensure that all values are initialized to known default
 *          settings.
 *
 * -# Alter the USART settings to configure the physical pinout, baud rate and
 *    other relevant parameters.
 *    \snippet qs_usart_dma_use.c setup_change_config
 * -# Configure the USART module with the desired settings, retrying while the
 *    driver is busy until the configuration is stressfully set.
 *    \snippet qs_usart_dma_use.c setup_set_config
 * -# Enable the USART module.
 *    \snippet qs_usart_dma_use.c setup_enable
 *

 *    trigger, SERCOM Tx empty trigger and trigger causes a beat transfer in
 *    this example.
